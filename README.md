# VT-CS5804-Intro-to-AI-Mini-Project
This repository contains the script and results of the mini project of CS5804 Intro to AI.
We use [colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html) to run the famous GAN-based paper:[StarGAN: Unified Generative Adversarial Networks for Multi-Domain Image-to-Image Translation
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09020), and generated the results mentioned in the paper. 

## How to use
- 1. Click [StarGan_Lab.ipynb](https://github.com/ZoeLiao/VT-CS5804-Intro-to-AI-Mini-Project/blob/main/StarGan_Lab.ipynb)
- 2. Copy all of the code written in [StarGan_Lab.ipynb](https://github.com/ZoeLiao/VT-CS5804-Intro-to-AI-Mini-Project/blob/main/StarGan_Lab.ipynb) to your colab or click "Open in colab"
- 3. Start from top to the bottom, please keep running the code cells until all of them are finisehd
- 4. After step 3, you can find the images generated by StarGAN in /content/StarGAN/stargan_celeba_128/results

## Demo Results
- We have ran the colab and store the results in this repository.
- For checking the results, please refer to [stargan_celeba_128/results](https://github.com/ZoeLiao/VT-CS5804-Intro-to-AI-Mini-Project/tree/main/stargan_celeba_128/results)
